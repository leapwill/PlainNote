# PlainNote
A simple note widget for Android

Based on [Jot by hellos3b](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simplidget.jot). I decided to make my own to be more customizable so it can better fit my homescreen styling.

## To do:
1. ~~Load and save a multi-line plain text message.~~
2. ~~Create a flexible launcher widget to display the message.~~
3. Create an icon and widget preview.
4. Publish on Play Store as minimum viable product?
5. Extend functionality by adding appearance customization options.
