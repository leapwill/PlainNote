# PlainNote
A simple note widget for Android

Based on [Jot by hellos3b](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simplidget.jot). I decided to make my own to be more customizable so it can better fit my homescreen styling.

Using the [color picker from martin-stone](https://github.com/martin-stone/hsv-alpha-color-picker-android) under the [Apache 2.0 license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), Copyright 2015 Martin Stone.

## To do:
1. ~~Load and save a multi-line plain text message.~~
2. ~~Create a flexible launcher widget to display the message.~~
3. ~~Create an icon and widget preview.~~
4. ~~Extend functionality by adding appearance customization options.~~
5. Publish on F-Droid
